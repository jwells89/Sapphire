{"name":"Sapphire","tagline":"A modern Mac web browser for power users","body":"##Sapphire\r\n![image](screenshot.png)\r\n###Description\r\nSapphire is a WebKit-based web browser for OS X 10.9 and above that focuses on providing power user features and a unique tab organization scheme alongside a sleek, modern UI. It's currently in its pre-alpha stage and is, for the time being, a hobby project.\r\n\r\n###Planned Features\r\n* Horizontal \"source list\" tab organization, including support for groups, smart groups, and sticky groups\r\n* Per-site settings, allowing Java, JavaScript, and web plugins to be enabled or disabled on a site-to-site basis\r\n* Per-site customizations through user stylesheets and JavaScript\r\n* HTML5 video and audio substitution in place of web plugins where possible'\r\n* Multi-service bookmark and history syncing\r\n* Robust, rule-based ad blocking\r\n* Extended multitouch gesture support\r\n* Flexible addon framework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n...and more.\r\n\r\n###Building Sapphire\r\nIn addition to downloading and building [The Omni Group](http://www.omnigroup.com/)'s OmniFoundation and OmniBase, you will need to supply a build of the WebKit frameworks (both nightly and system-included variations work). Dependency on the Omni frameworks will be removed in a future commit.\r\n\r\n###Using Sapphire\r\nPlease note that Sapphire is far from complete and while it is functional enough for daily use, many features are missing or may work incorrectly. If you use it as your primary web browser, you are doing so at your own risk.\r\n\r\n###License\r\nSapphire is licensed under [BSDv3](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).
